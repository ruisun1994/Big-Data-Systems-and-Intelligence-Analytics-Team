In Class Progress Reports Next Week

What you need to do:

1. Clearly describe the project and thesis.

2, Show EVIDENCE of progress.

3, Discuss next steps and thoughts.

Be ready to present. If nobody volunteers I'll call names.

Attendance during in class progress reports will be taken. YOU WILL BE DEDUCTED POINTS FOR MISSING IN CLASS PROGRESS REPORTS even those where you don't present

Everyone in the group must upload the report or  a note saying who uploaded it and the group members by the end of the week.  Note, you upload your report AFTER you present it in class.



What REQUIRED attendance means?

Attendance is REQUIRED even when you don't present.  If you don't attend two sessions you'll get attendance points deducted. 

E-mailing me saying you scheduled an interview, are out of town, feel stressed, or have a twerking battle during class time doesn't excuse you from REQUIRED attendance.

If you choose to attend only once to present, but are not supporting your colleagues you WILL get attendance points deducted.

And no it's NOT OK to present your report to the TAs at some later date.

The only time attendance is required is the in-class presentations. These dates are known weeks ahead.
